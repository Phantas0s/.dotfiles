# Every section that isn't one of the above is interpreted as a rules
# to override settings for certain messages.
# Messages can be matched by 'appname', 'summary', 'body' or 'icon'
# and you can override the 'timeout', 'urgency', 'foreground', 'background'
# and 'format'.
# Shell-like globbing will get expanded.
#
# SCRIPTING
# you can specify a script that gets run when the rule matches by setting
# the 'script' option.
# The script will be called as follows:
# script appname summary body icon urgency
# where urgency can be "LOW", "NORMAL" or "CRITICAL".
#
# NOTE: if you don't want a notification to be displayed, set the format to ""
# NOTE: It might be helpful to run dunst -print in a terminal in order to find
# fitting options for rules.
